# FBLA Mini Game Mania
Jonathan McLatcher and Dhruv Kulkarni's submission for the 2019 FBLA-NLC Computer Game and Simulation Programming competition.

## Preview

Thank you for your interest and taking the time to play our game. Hope you enjoy!

All assets were 100% made from scratch. All the animations, models, UI components, and code were created from scratch, by hand.

The only asset pack used was "Simple UI Elements". The pack was used for basic UI starter backgrounds and images.
You can view it [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/simple-ui-elements-53276 "Simple UI Elements") on the Unity Asset Store.

## Instructions for Opening the Game

Download the project and simply double-click on the shortcut called "FBLA Mini Game Mania" to play the game. All of the source code and other project files are located inside the main folder ("GEORGIA_JOHNSCREEK") in a sub-folder called "FBLA Simulation and Programming 2018-2019"

If you see a "file path too long" error while extracting, simply click "Skip" and "Do this for all items", or use [7-Zip File Manager](https://www.7-zip.org/ "7-Zip File Manager").

## How To Play

You will spawn into a convention center surrounded by rooms with exciting mini games to play!

Use the "WASD" keys to move and look around by using the Mouse.

Walk up the table in each room to play a mini game. Obtain Rep Points by playing and completing these mini games. 
Obtaining Rep Points will gain you Supporters.       

Once you have played all the mini games in the level, move on to the next level by walking up to the closed door. When you complete all of the mini games, move on to the final room where a surprise will be waiting. Good Luck! 

## Extra Notes

There is a Sensitivity Slider that will change the mouse look sensitivity if you need. You can access this by pressing the escape key in the main game.
