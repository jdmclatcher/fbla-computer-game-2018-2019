FBLA Project for Computer Game and Simulation Competition for 2018-2019!

## Instructions for Opening/Playing the Game

Download the project or just the Folder titled "MINIGAMEMANIA_JOHNSCREEK.zip" in the git repository and unzip the folder. Click on the ".exe" to run and play the game.

## How To Play

You will spawn into a convention center surrounded by booths with exciting mini games to play!

Use the "WASD" keys to move and look around using the Mouse or Arrow Keys.

Walk up to each booth to play a mini game. Obtain Rep Points by playing and completing these mini games. 
Obtaining Rep Points will gain you Supporters.       

Once you have played all the mini games in the level, move on to the next level. When you complete all of the mini games, move on to the final room where a surprise will be waiting. Good Luck! 

## Extra Notes

There is a Sensitivity Slider that will change the mouse look sensitivity if you need. You can access this by pressing the escape key in the main game.
