# FBLA Mini Game Mania
Jonathan McLatcher and Dhruv Kulkarni's submission for the 2019 FBLA-SLC Computer Game and Simulation Programming competition.

## Preview

Thank you for your interest and taking the time to play our game. Hope you enjoy!

All assets were 100% made from scratch. All the animations, models, UI components, and code were created from scratch, by hand.

The only asset pack used was "SimpleUIElements". The pack was used for basic UI starter backgrounds and images.
You can view it here on the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/icons/simple-ui-elements-53276 

## Instructions for Opening/Playing the Game

Download the project and the playable game will be located in the folder titled "MINIGAMEMANIA_JOHNSCREEK". Click on the ".exe" inside that folder to run and play the game.

## How To Play

You will spawn into a convention center surrounded by rooms with exciting mini games to play!

Use the "WASD" keys to move and look around by using the Mouse.

Walk up the booth in each room to play a mini game. Obtain Rep Points by playing and completing these mini games. 
Obtaining Rep Points will gain you Supporters.       

Once you have played all the mini games in the level, move on to the next level by walking up to the closed door. When you complete all of the mini games, move on to the final room where a surprise will be waiting. Good Luck! 

## Extra Notes

There is a Sensitivity Slider that will change the mouse look sensitivity if you need. You can access this by pressing the escape key in the main game.
